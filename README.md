# NIE Appointment Bot

This is an automated bot written in JavaScript to check and search for available NIE appointments in Spain, using Playwright. 

It was created to simplify the process of checking appointments, which requires manually selecting province and procedure, entering personal information, and checking availabilityâ€”making it unnecessarily time-consuming.

You can run this project locally or as a GitHub Action.
